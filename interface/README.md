# Interface

Interface defines the rules for library developers.
By rules we mean a set of header files that defines the function interfaces, data structures to connect any external libraries to the SDK.

By following these rules,
- smoothen the learning curve for using a new libraries by giving the same type of library a uniform calling interface
- library developers no longer need to worry about how to connect with other libraries
