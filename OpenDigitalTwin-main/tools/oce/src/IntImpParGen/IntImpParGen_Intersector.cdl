inherits Intersection from IntRes2d

      	---Purpose: Calculates all the IntersectionPoints 
      	--          and IntersectionSegments between an implicit curve
      	--          (see class ImpTool) and a parametrised curve (see class
      	--          ParTool) on their domains.
      	--          The results of the intersection are stored in the 
      	--          Intersection class from IntRes2d.
      	--          The parametrised curve has to be bounded (the domain
      	--          of this curve must verify HasFirstPoint returns True
      	--          and HasLastPoint returns True).
