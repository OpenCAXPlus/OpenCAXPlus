##Command "checkshape" does not define self-crossing for some wires and assigns status "valid" for them.
## NOTE akm: there is no actual intersection - it was a bug in displaying complicated curves (my patch deals with it)
## NOTE akm: wire alone is only a curve in the space so it may intersect itself.
## NOTE akm: bug after putting it on plane checkshape found the pb.
