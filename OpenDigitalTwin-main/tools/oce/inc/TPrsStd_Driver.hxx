//! Driver for AIS
//! ==============
//! An abstract class, which - in classes inheriting
//! from it - allows you to update an
//! AIS_InteractiveObject or create one if one does
//! not already exist.
//! For both creation and update, the interactive
//! object is filled with information contained in
//! attributes. These attributes are those found on
//! the label given as an argument in the method Update.
//! true is returned if the interactive object was modified by the update.
//! This class  provide  an algorithm  to  Build with its  default
//! values (if Null) or Update (if !Null) an AIS_InteractiveObject
//! .   Resources are found  in  attributes associated to  a given
//! label.
