//! Defines print algorithm
//! Aspect_PrintAlgo:
//! 1) PA_STRETCH - Stretch offscreen printing frame
//! if its dimensions are smaller than
//! the printer's printing area dimensions;
//! This algorithm is more reliable as it
//! works on any hardware and is recommended
//! to be used with average printing resolutions,
//! as it more RAM memory dependent than PA_TILE;
//! Stretching is performend using bicubic interpolation
//! algorithm from FreeImage library if OCCT is built
//! with FreeImage support, otherwise Windows API
//! StretchBlt() function in STRETCH_HALFTONE mode
//! is used;
//! 2) PA_TILE    - If the offscreen printing frame dimensions
//! are smaller than the printer's printing
//! area dimensions - use multiple printing
//! frames to cover the whole printing area
