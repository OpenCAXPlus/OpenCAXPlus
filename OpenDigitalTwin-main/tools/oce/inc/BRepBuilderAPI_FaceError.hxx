//! Indicates the outcome of the

//! not, as explained below:
//! -      BRepBuilderAPI_FaceDone No error occurred. The face is
//! correctly built.
//! -      BRepBuilderAPI_NoFace No initialization of the
//! algorithm; only an empty constructor was used.
//! -      BRepBuilderAPI_NotPlanar
//! No surface was given and the wire was not planar.
//! -      BRepBuilderAPI_CurveProjectionFailed
//! Not used so far.
//! -      BRepBuilderAPI_ParametersOutOfRange
//! The parameters given to limit the surface are out of its    bounds.
