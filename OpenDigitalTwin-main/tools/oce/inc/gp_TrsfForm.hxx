//! Identifies the type of a geometric transformation.
//! Enumerates all 24 possible variants of generalized
//! Euler angles, defining general 3d rotation by three
//! rotations around main axes of coordinate system,
//! in different possible orders.
//! The name of the enumeration
//! corresponds to order of rotations, prefixed by type
//! of co-ordinate system used:
//! - Intrinsic: rotations are made around axes of rotating
//! co-ordinate system associated with the object
//! - Extrinsic: rotations are made around axes of fixed
//! (reference) co-ordinate system
//! Two specific values provided for most frequently used
//! conventions: proper Euler angles (intrinsic ZXZ) and
//! yaw-pitch-roll (intrinsic ZYX).
