//! Provides an algorithm to compute a distribution of
//! points on a 'C2' continuous curve. The algorithm
//! respects a criterion of maximum deflection between
//! the curve and the polygon that results from the computed points.
//! Note: This algorithm is relatively time consuming. A
//! GCPnts_QuasiUniformDeflection algorithm is
//! quicker; it can also work with non-'C2' continuous
//! curves, but it generates more points in the distribution.

  //! This and the above methods initialize (or reinitialize) this algorithm and
  //! compute a distribution of points:
  //! -   on the curve C, or
  //! -   on the part of curve C limited by the two
  //! parameter values U1 and U2,
  //! where the maximum distance between C and the
  //! polygon that results from the points of the
  //! distribution is not greater than Deflection.
  //! The first point of the distribution is either the origin
  //! of curve C or the point of parameter U1. The last
  //! point of the distribution is either the end point of
  //! curve C or the point of parameter U2. Intermediate
  //! points of the distribution are built using
  //! interpolations of segments of the curve limited at
  //! the 2nd degree. The construction ensures, in a first
  //! step, that the chordal deviation for this
  //! interpolation of the curve is less than or equal to
  //! Deflection. However, it does not ensure that the
  //! chordal deviation for the curve itself is less than or
  //! equal to Deflection. To do this a check is
  //! necessary, which may generate (second step)
  //! additional intermediate points. This check is time
  //! consuming, and can be avoided by setting
  //! WithControl to false. Note that by default
  //! WithControl is true and check is performed.
  //! Use the function IsDone to verify that the
  //! computation was successful, the function NbPoints
  //! to obtain the number of points of the computed
  //! distribution, and the function Parameter to read
  //! the parameter of each point.
  //! Warning
  //! -   C is necessary, 'C2' continuous. This property is
  //! not checked at construction time.
  //! -   The roles of U1 and U2 are inverted if U1 > U2.
  //! Warning
  //! C is an adapted curve, i.e. an object which is an interface between:
  //! -   the services provided by either a 2D curve from
  //! the package Geom2d (in the case of an
  //! Adaptor2d_Curve2d curve) or a 3D curve from
  //! the package Geom (in the case of an Adaptor3d_Curve curve),
  //! -   and those required on the curve by the computation algorithm.
