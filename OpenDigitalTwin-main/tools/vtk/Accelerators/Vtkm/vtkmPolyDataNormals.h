/**
 * @class   vtkmPolyDataNormals
 * @brief   compute normals for polygonal mesh
 *
 * vtkmPolyDataNormals is a filter that computes point and/or cell normals
 * for a polygonal mesh. The user specifies if they would like the point
 * and/or cell normals to be computed by setting the ComputeCellNormals
 * and ComputePointNormals flags.
 *
 * The computed normals (a vtkFloatArray) are set to be the active normals
 * (using SetNormals()) of the PointData and/or the CellData (respectively)
 * of the output PolyData. The name of these arrays is "Normals".
 *
 * The algorithm works by determining normals for each polygon and then
 * averaging them at shared points.
 *
 * @warning
 * Normals are computed only for polygons and triangles. Normals are
 * not computed for lines, vertices, or triangle strips.
 *
 * @sa
 * For high-performance rendering, you could use vtkmTriangleMeshPointNormals
 * if you know that you have a triangle mesh which does not require splitting
 * nor consistency check on the cell orientations.
