This directory contains a slightly modifed version of Metis (see the
"Gmsh" tags in the code; the purpose of the changes is only to make the
library compile on all the architectures supported by Gmsh)

The original source code must be distributed.

Christophe,

You can do that but be aware that metis/parmetis is not being distributed
under an open source license.

Dear George,

For the past few years a colleague and I have been developing an open
source finite element mesh generator and pre-/post-processor
(http://geuz.org/gmsh/). We would like to distribute METIS (and
eventually PARMETIS) with the application. Can we do so?

Thanks to let me know.

Best wishes,

Christophe
