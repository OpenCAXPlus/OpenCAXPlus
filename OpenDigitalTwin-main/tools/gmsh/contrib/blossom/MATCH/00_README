The file match.tar should consist of the following files:

./MATCH/00_README       this file
./MATCH/100.dat         example x-y file
./MATCH/100.edge        example edge-file
./MATCH/Makefile        gmake Makefile
./MATCH/mat_main.c      main program for blossom4 code
./MATCH/match.[ch]      matching routines
./MATCH/matprice.[ch]   pricing routines
./MATCH/mp_main.c       main program for price4 code
./MATCH/tri_call.c      program to call the triangle package

------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

This package is an add-up to the concorde package written
by Applegate, Bixby, Chvatal and Cook and which can be 
found at <http://www.concorde.com/>.

Type 'tar xvf match.tar', the MATCH directory will be created.
Type 'cd MATCH' to get to the MATCH directory.

To built the programs, first look at the Makefile and insert 
the right compiler, compiling options and the concorde 
directory (this is the directory with the concorde.a and the
concorde.h file).

After that just type 'make' or e.g. 'make blossom4', if you
just want to get the blossom4 program. Other possibilities
are 'make price4' or 'make tri_call'.

------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

After the programs are built, you can use them in the 
following way:

- blossom4
    Type blossom4 to see different options.
    Here some standard calls:

    blossom4 -k 1000 
        Calculate matching for 1000 random points.

    blossom4 -k 1000 -s 1 
        Calculate matching for 1000 random points
        with random seed 1.

    blossom4 -x 100.dat 
        Calculate matching with the points from the file
        100.dat.

    blossom4 -b -x 12345.bin  -e 12345.del -5 
        Calculate matching with the points from the binary
        file 12345.bin, starting with the edge-set 12345.del 
        and working with the ATT norm.

    blossom4 -e 12345.del -B 12345.price
        Calculate matching for the graph 12345.del and write 
        the data necessary for the pricing program to the file
        12345.price.

- price4

    Type price4 to see different options.
    Here is a standard call:

    price4 -b -n 12345.bin -d 12345.price -o 12345.bad.edges
        Calculate the bad edges for the pricing file generated
        with the blossom4 call above.

- tri_call
    All the necessary information about tri_call can be found
    in the header of the tri_call.c file.
 
For further information about options and file-formats
see the concorde README file.
