The following sections are for the SDK developers. 
Notice, the SDK developer and application developer are different. 
SDK developers contribute codes to our git repository, while application developers use the SDK in their own code to create a new CAX application, in other words, they are the SDK user.

For SDK users, you don't need to read this developer guide in order to become proficient in using the SDK, so please go to the [user manual](../user/index.md), and start from there.
