# Overview

The main goal of this project to provide a SDK (software development kit) that does the tedious works in building an CAX application for you, such as
- create wrapper functions that allow the developer to use multiple open source libraries seamlessly
- installing and linking necessary libraries
- GUI interface
- cross platform project setup
- documentation/landing page setup
- automated CICD setup
- automated packaging and publishing

The SDK also aims to impose no rules on how the developers should write their application, developers still have full control of the core logic of your application.

Starting from our starter templates, developers are able to spawn an production ready application in no time.
